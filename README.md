How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  I tried to ensure that my program and code was functional in testing the code and covering all possible defects.
  I also tried to ensure that the code was secure in using security techniques taught in earlier classes and to close off any
  possible opening that a third party might be able to exploit.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  I tried my best to interpret the needs of the user through outlining the code requirements that were given in the initial project post and and the assignment
  requirements.

How do I approach designing software?
  Like I stated in my project 2 summary and reflection I try to approach designing software in a real world scenario but also try to keep to tried and
  tested methods to cut down on time spent testing and building the code, since my work schedule keeps me from applying a large amount of time to class work.
  I find that this fits into a real world scenario where a company might want to go this route for this project since it would cut down overall time spent
  and money spent of building and testing this project.
